# bear-minimum
A to-do list app for just the basics.

I made this to practice SwiftUI.
The app encourages you to eat 3 meals, drink plenty of water, and exercise on a daily basis.
It also keeps track of how many consecutive days you complete your tasks, encouraging healthy behaviors via gamification.
